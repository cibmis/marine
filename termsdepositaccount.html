                <p><strong>AGREEMENT</strong> - This, document, along with
                  any other documents we give you pertaining to your account(s),
                  is a contract that establishes rules which control your account(s)
                  with us. Please read this carefully. If you sign the signature
                  card or continue to have your account with us, you agree
                  to these rules. You will receive a separate schedule of rates,
                  qualifying balances, and fees if they are not included in
                  this document. If you have any questions, please call us. </p>
                  <p>This agreement is subject to applicable federal laws and
                    the laws of the state of Wisconsin (except to the extent
                    that this agreement can and does vary such rules or laws).
                    The body of state and federal law that governs our relationship
                    with you, however, is too large and complex to be reproduced
                    here. The purpose of this document is to: </p>
                    <p>
                  1. Summarize some laws that apply to common transactions; <br />
                  2. establish rules to cover transactions or events which the law does not
                  regulate; <br />
                  3. establish rules for certain transactions or events which the law regulates
                  but permits variation by agreement; and <br />
                  4. give you disclosures of some of our policies to which you may be entitled
                  or in which you may be interested.</p>
<p>If any provisions of this document is found to be unenforceable
  according to its terms, all remaining provision will continue in
  full force and effect. We may permit some variations from our standard
  agreement but we must agree to any variation in writing either
  on the signature card for your account or in some other document. </p>
                  <p>As used in this document the words "we," "our," and "us" mean
                    the financial institution and the words "you" and "your" mean the
                    account holder(s) and anyone else with the authority to deposit,
                    withdraw, or exercise control over the funds in the account. The
                    headings in this document are for convenience or reference only
                    and will not govern the interpretation of the provisions. Unless
                    it would be inconsistent to do so, words and phrases used in this
                    document should be construed so the singular includes the plural
                    and the plural includes the singular. </p>
                  <p><strong>LIABILITY</strong> - You agree, for yourself (and
                    the person or entity you represent if you sign as a representative
                    of another) to the terms of this account and the schedule
                    of charges. You authorize us to deduct these charges directly
                    from the account balance as accrued. You will pay any additional
                    reasonable charges for services you request which are not
                    covered by this agreement. </p>
                  <p>Each of you also agrees to be jointly and severally (individually)
                    liable for any account shortage resulting from charges
                    or overdrafts, whether caused by you or another with access
                    to this account. This liability is due immediately, and
                    can be deducted directly from the account balance whenever
                    sufficient funds are available. You have no right to defer
                    payment of this liability, and you are liable regardless
                    of whether you signed the item or benefited from the charge
                    or overdraft. This includes liability for our costs to
                    collect the deficit , to the extent permitted by law, including
                    our reasonable attorney's fees. </p>
                  <p><strong>DEPOSITS</strong> - We will give only provisional
                    credit until collection is final for any items, other than
                    cash, we accept for deposit (including items drawn "on us").
                    Actual credit for deposits of, or payable in, foreign currency
                    will be at the exchange rate in effect on final collection
                    in U.S. dollars. We are not responsible for transactions
                    by mail or outside depository until we actually record them.
                    We will treat and record all transactions received after
                    our "daily cutoff time" on a business day we are open, or
                    received on a day we are not open for business, as if initiated
                    on the next following business day that we are open. </p>
                  <p><strong>WITHDRAWALS</strong> - Unless clearly indicated
                    otherwise on the account records, any of you, acting alone,
                    who signs in the space designated for signatures on the signature
                    card may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the account
                    balance at any time. Each of you (until we receive written
                    notice to the contrary) authorizes each other person signing
                    the signature card to indorse any item payable to you or
                    your order for deposit to this account or any other transaction
                    with us. We may charge your account for a check even though
                    payment was made before the date of check, unless we have
                    received written notice of the postdating in time to have
                    a reasonable opportunity to act. We may refuse any withdrawal
                    or transfer request which you attempt on forms not approved
                    by us, by any method we do not specifically permit, which
                    is greater in number than the frequency permitted, or which
                    is for an amount greater or less than any withdrawal limitations.
                    Even if we honor a nonconforming request, we may treat continued
                    abuse of the stated limitations (if any) as your act of closing
                    the account. We will use the date the transaction is completed
                    by us (as opposed to the date you initiate it) to apply the
                    frequency limitations. The fact that we may honor withdrawal
                    request that overdraws the available account balance does
                    not obligate us to do so later. See the funds availability
                    policy disclosure for information about when you can withdraw
                    funds you deposit. For those accounts for which our funds
                    availability policy disclosure does not apply, you can ask
                    us when you make a deposit when those funds will be available
                    for withdrawal. </p>
                  <p>We may require not less than 7 days' notice in writing
                    before each withdrawal from an interest-bearing account
                    other than a time deposit, or form any other savings account
                    as defined by Regulation D. Withdrawals from a time account
                    prior to maturity or prior to any notice period may be
                    restricted and may be subject to penalty. See your notice
                    of penalty for early withdrawal. </p>
                  <p><strong>OWNERSHIP
                    OF ACCOUNT AND BENEFICIARY DESIGATION</strong> - These
                    rules apply to this account depending on the form of ownership
                    and beneficiary designation, if any, specified on the account
                    records. We make no representations to the appropriateness
                    or effect of the ownership and beneficiary designations,
                    except as they determine to whom we pay the account funds.<br /><strong>Individual Account</strong> - is an account
                    in the name of one person.<br /> <strong>Joint Account - with Survivorship
                      (And Not As Tenants In Common) </strong> -
                    is an account in the name of two or more persons. Each of
                    you intends that when you die the balance in the account
                    (subject to any previous pledge to which we have agreed)
                    will belong to the survivor(s). If two or more of you survive,
                    you will own the balance in the account as joint tenants
                    with survivorship and not as tenants in common.<br /> <strong>Joint
                      Account - No Survivorship (As Tenants In common)</strong> - is
                    owned by two or more persons, but none of you intend (merely
                    by opening this account) to create any right of survivorship
                    in any other person. We encourage you to agree and tell using
                    writing of the percentage of the deposit contributed by each
                    of you. This information will not, however, affect the "number
                    of signatures" necessary for withdrawal.<br /> <strong>Pay-On-Death
                      Account</strong> - Pay-On-Death accounts may be created only
                    if one person owns the account. Revocable Trust accounts
                    may be created by accounts with one or more owners. If two
                    or more of you create a Revocable Trust account, you own
                    the account jointly with survivorship. Beneficiaries of either
                    of these account types cannot withdraw unless: (1) all persons
                    creating the account die, and (2) the beneficiary is then
                    living. If two or more beneficiaries are named and survive
                    the death of the owner(s) of the account, such beneficiaries
                    will own this account in equal shares, without right of survivorship.
                    The person(s) creating either a Pay-On-Death or Revocable
                    Trust account reserves the right to: (1) change beneficiaries,
                    (2) change account types, and (3) withdraw all or part of
                    the account funds at any time. </p>
                  <p><strong>BUSINESS
                    ACCOUNTS</strong> - Earnings in the form
                    of interest, dividends, or credits will be paid only on collected
                    funds, unless otherwise provided by law or our policy. We
                    may require the governing body of the legal entity opening
                    the account to give us a separate authorization telling us
                    who is authorized to act on its behalf. We will honor the
                    authorization until we actually receive written notice of
                    a change from the governing body of the legal entity. </p>
                  <p><strong>STOP PAYMENTS</strong> - You must make any stop-payment
                    order in the manner required by law and we must receive it
                    in time to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on it
                    before our stop-payment cutoff time. To be effective your
                    stop-payment order must precisely identify the number, date
                    and amount of the item, and the payee. </p>
                  <p>You may stop payment on any item drawn on your account
                    whether you sign the item or not, if you have an equal
                    or greater right to withdraw from this account than the
                    person who signed the item. A release of the stop-payment
                    request may be made only by the person who initiated the
                    stop-payment order. </p>
                  <p>Our stop-payment cutoff time is on hour after the opening
                    of the next banking day after the banking day on which
                    we receive the item. Additional limitations on our obligation
                    to stop payment are provided by law (e.g., we paid the
                    item in cash or we certified the item). </p>
                  <p><strong>TELEPHONE
                    TRANSFERS</strong> - A telephone transfer
                    of funds from this account to another account with us, if
                    otherwise arranged for or permitted, may be made by the same
                    persons and under the same conditions generally applicable
                    to withdrawals made in writing. Unless a different limitation
                    is disclosed in writing, we restrict the number of transfers
                    from a savings account to another account or to third parties,
                    to a maximum of six per month (less the number of "preauthorized
                    transfers" during the month). Other account transfer restrictions
                    may be described elsewhere. </p>
                  <p><strong>AMENDMENTS
                    AND TERMINATION</strong> - We may change
                    any term of this agreement. Rules governing changes in interest
                    rates are provided separately. For other changes, we will
                    give you reasonable notice in writing or by any other method
                    permitted by law. We may also close this account at any time
                    upon reasonable notice to you and tender of the account balance
                    personally or by mail. Notice from us to any one of you is
                    notice to all of you. </p>
                  <p><strong>STATEMENTS</strong> - You must examine your statement
                    of account with "reasonable promptness." If you discover
                    (or reasonably should have discovered) any unauthorized signatures
                    or alterations, you must promptly notify us of the relevant
                    facts. As between you and us, if you fail to do either of
                    these duties, you will have to either share loss with us,
                    or bear the loss entirely yourself (depending on whether
                    we used ordinary care and, if not, whether we substantially
                    contributed to the loss). The loss could be not only with
                    respect to items on the statement but other items with unauthorized
                    signatures or alterations by the same wrongdoer. </p>
                  <p>You agree that the time you have to examine your statement
                    and report to us will depend on the circumstances, but
                    will not, in any circumstance, exceed a total of 30 days
                    from when the statement is first sent or made available
                    to you. </p>
                  <p>You further agree that if you fail to report any unauthorized
                    signatures, alterations, forgeries, or any other errors
                    in your account within 60 days of when we first send or
                    make the statement available, you cannot assert a claim
                    against us on any items in that statement and as between
                    you and us the loss will be entirely yours. This 60-day
                    limitation is without regard to whether we used ordinary
                    care. The limitation in this paragraph is in addition to
                    that contained in the first paragraph of this section. </p>
                  <p><strong>ACCOUNT
                    TRANSFER</strong> - This account may not
                    be transferred or assigned without our prior written consent. </p>
                  <p><strong>DIRECT
                    DEPOSITS</strong> - If, in connection with
                    a direct deposit plan, we deposit any amount in an account
                    which should have been returned to the Federal Government
                    for any reason, you authorize us to deduct the amount of
                    our liability to the Federal Government from the account
                    or from any other account you have with us, without prior
                    notice and at any time, except as prohibited by law. We may
                    also use any other legal remedy to recover the amount of
                    our liability. </p>
                  <p><strong>TEMPORARY
                    ACCOUNT AGREEMENT</strong> - If this
                    option is selected, this is a temporary account agreement.
                    Each person who signs in the space designated for signatures
                    on the signature card (except as indicated to the contrary)
                    may transact business on this account. However, we may at
                    some time in the future restrict or prohibit further use
                    of this account if you fail to comply with the requirements
                    we have imposed within a reasonable time. </p>
                  <p><strong>SETOFF</strong> - We may (without prior notice
                    and when permitted by law) setoff the funds in this account against
                    any due and payable debt you owe us now or in the future,
                    by any of you having the right of withdrawal, to the extent
                    of such persons' or legal entity's right to withdraw. If
                    the debt arises from a note, "any due and payable debt" includes

                    capacity. We will not be liable for the dishonor of any
                    check when the dishonor occurs because we setoff a debt

                    any claim arising as a result of our exercise of our right
