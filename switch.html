                <p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><br />
                <strong>Q.  What if I don't have my Marine Bank account number?</strong><br />
                A.  You'll need your Marine Bank Account number to complete the forms and letters. You should complete all fields to ensure that your letters are accurate.</p>
                   
                <p><strong>Q. How can I close more than one old bank account?</strong><br />
                A.  Easy enough, just follow the closing account instructions listed above for each of your accounts that you wish to close and forward the request to close account form to each Financial Institution.
                   
                <p><strong>Q. Who do I call if I have questions?</strong><br />

                A.  It's very easy to move your accounts to Marine Bank, and still be able to write checks and access to your funds. Stop by your nearest branch and open your new Marine Bank Small Business Checking account. Once you receive your new checks, move any excess balances from your old account (leaving enough to cover outstanding checks and automatic withdrawals), begin depositing into your new Marine Bank account, and start using your new account. When your checks have all cleared in your old bank account and all automatic withdrawals have transferred, you can close the old account.

Small Business owners can also use direct deposit to receive credit card settlements and accounts receivable payments. Your funds are deposited electronically into your bank account. No need to worry about receiving a check and making a special trip to the bank.
