                <p>CIBM BANK offers a variety of Web-based                      banking services. To ensure that these services are provided                      in a secure and private manner, CIBM Bank uses a full range of Internet security measures designed                      to protect our customers and the bank. These security measures                      include the use of cryptography; secure browsers and servers,                      routers and firewalls, SSL protocol, digital certificates,                      passwords and PINs, and cookies. The security measures allow                      CIB Marine Bancshares, Inc. to properly authenticate and                      identify our customers accessing our Online Banking Services,                      and to protect your personal information, as it travels over                      the Internet. </p>

                <p>CRYPTOGRAPHY - All customer information is encrypted and                      authenticated using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. SSL                      allows for information to be sent and received securely over                      the Internet. When a SSL connection occurs, security features                      within the browser and the server create a secure connection,                      in which all information shared is encrypted and de-crypted                      by only the intended recipients, ensuring that all data and                      transactions are secure as they are communicated over the                      Internet.</p>
                <p>FIREWALLS - Firewalls are a combination of hardware and                      software that measure and limit access to a server or network                      for security purposes. The firewall is a system between the                      Internet and a network to provide security from the Internet                      to the internal network. The firewall keeps track of transaction                      activity, the time of each transaction, and who performed                      it.</p>
                <p>COOKIES - Each browser accessing CIBM Bank's Online Banking Service is given a "cookie".                      A "cookie" is a piece of information sent by a                      web server to a web browser. The web browser saves and sends                      the cookie back to the server each time the browser accesses                      the site. Cookies allow a web site to identify whether or                      not a user previously visited the site. </p>

Please                      be aware that passwords can remain in your browser's                      cache, and anyone might gain access if your computer is left                      unattended. Please refer to the "Protecting Your Password" section                      of the Internet User Agreement.
