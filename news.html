                <h6>September 9, 2014</h6>
                <p>Brookfield, WI:  National Night Out provides citizens with educational opportunities to learn about a multitude of things concerning law enforcement, such as safety and crime prevention tips, disaster preparedness, identity theft protection, Internet Safety, drug abuse prevention and much more. The event usually draws up to 3,000 people per year.</p>
                <p>Some of this year's offerings were self defense demos, the Waukesha County Incident Command Post and Canine Units, the Flight for Light Helicopter, as well as food and many other family oriented activities.</p>
                <p>Employees traditionally volunteer at the Information Booth and hand out event t-shirts. This year we also gave out Marine Bank glow necklaces, which were a HUGE HIT amongst kids of all ages.</p>
                <p>We had a blast at the event and are looking forward to next year!</p>

                <h6>August 1, 1014</h6>
                <p>Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) were established in 2003 so that individuals covered by high-deductible health plans could receive tax-preferred treatment of money saved for medical expenses.  Generally, an adult who is covered by a high-deductible health plan (and has no other first-dollar coverage) may establish an HSA.  Health Savings Accounts differ from Flex Spending Accounts (FSAs) and Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs).  They are owned by the individual and funds roll over year to year if not spent.  HSAs may currently be used to pay for qualified medical expenses.</p>
                <p>According to the Society for Human Resource Management, the number of businesses offering HSAs has risen dramatically recently.  For more information visit:  <a class="alertexit" href="http://www.shrm.org/hrdisciplines/benefits/articles/pages/hsas-outpacing-hras.aspx">http://www.shrm.org/hrdisciplines/benefits/articles/pages/hsas-outpacing-hras.aspx </a></p>
                <p>As a business owner, a high deductible health plan may be right for your company.  Health Savings Accounts can be a great addition to your company’s benefit package as they can be a good way for you and your employees to supplement that higher deductible.</p>
                <p>As an individual participating in a high deductible health plan, whether you are planning ahead to pay for unexpected medical expenses or strategizing to offset your high deductible, a HSA could help you save money.</p>

                <h6>Auguat 1, 2014</h6>
                <p>On July 25th and 26th Marine Bank sponsored two fun filled days at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the Brickyard 400. Guests enjoyed the event from a suite on turn two - the closest seating to the track, other than pit row.  The event included food, beverages, and pit passes.  Everyone was able to watch the cars practice and qualify leading up to the Brickyard Grand Prix (TUDOR Series) Friday and the NASCAR Nationwide Series race Saturday. Everyone had a great time.  A few employees and clients even ended up on ESPN, including our very own Brian Chaffin, Market President. </p>
