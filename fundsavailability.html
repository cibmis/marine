                <p><strong>Your Ability to Withdraw Funds</strong><br />
                Our policy is to make funds from your deposits available to you on the first business day after we receive your deposit.  Electronic direct deposits will be available on the day we receive the deposit.  At that time you can withdraw the funds in cash and we will use the funds to pay checks that you have written.</p>
                <p>For determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day, except Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays.  If you make a deposit before that branch&rsquo;s posted cut-off time on a business day we are open, we will consider that day the day of your deposit.  However, if you make a deposit after that branch&rsquo;s posted cut-off time or on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit was made on the next business day we are open.<br />
                </p>
                <p><strong>Longer Delays May Apply</strong><br />
                In some cases, we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by check available to you on the first business day after the day of your deposit.  Funds may not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit.  However, the first $200 of your deposit will be available on the first business day after the day of your deposit. </p>
                <p>If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit available on the first business day after we receive your deposit we will notify you at the time you make your deposit.  We will also tell you when the funds will be available.  If your deposit is not made directly to one of our employees or if we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you the notice by the business day after we receive your deposit.  If you need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available. </p>
                <p>Funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances:<br />
                </p>

                <p>
                - You deposit checks totaling more than $5,000 on any one day.<br />
                - You redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid. <br />
                - You have overdrawn your account repeatedly in the last six months.<br />
                - We believe a check you deposit will not be paid.<br />
                - There is an emergency, such as failure of communications or computer equipment.<br /></p>
           
                <p>We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons and we will tell you when the funds will be available.  They will generally be available no later than the seventh business day after the day of your deposit.</p>
                <p>In addition, if we cash a check for you that is drawn on another bank, we may withhold the availability of a corresponding amount of funds that are already in your account.  Those funds will be available at the time funds from the check we cashed would have been available if you had deposited it.<br />
                </p>
                <p><strong>Special Rules for New Accounts</strong><br />
                  If you are a new customer, the following special rules will apply during the first 30 days your account is open.</p>
                <p>Funds from electronic direct deposits will be available on the day we receive the deposit.  Funds from deposits of cash, wire transfers, and the first $5,000 of a day&rsquo;s total deposit of cashier&rsquo;s, certified, teller&rsquo;s, traveler&rsquo;s, and federal, state and local government checks will be available on the first business day of your deposit if the deposit meets certain conditions.   For example, the checks must be payable to you and you may have to use a special deposit slip.  The excess over $5,000 will be available on the ninth business day after the day of your deposit.  If your deposit of these checks (other than the U.S. Treasury check) is not made in person to one of our employees, the first $5,000 will not be available until the 2nd business day after your deposit. </p>
                <p>Funds from all other check deposits will be available no later than the eleventh business day after the day of your deposit. </p>
                <p><strong>Deposits at Automated Teller Machines</strong><br />
                Funds from any deposits (cash or checks) made at automated teller machines will not be available until the fifth business day after the day of your deposit. </p>
